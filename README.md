# ViNotebook - React Notebook App

ViNotebook is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application designed to provide a secure and personalized note-taking experience. With ViNotebook, users can create an account, log in securely, and manage their notes with ease.

## Features
* __Secure Authentication:__ ViNotebook employs JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication, ensuring that user data remains protected. Additionally, the bcrypt package is utilized to hash sensitive information, enhancing security measures.
*  __Personalized Note Management:__ Each user has exclusive access to their notes, ensuring privacy and confidentiality. Users can create, delete, modify, and read their notes seamlessly.

## Technology Stack

* __Frontend:__ Developed using React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
* __Backend:__ Built with Node.js and Express.js, providing robust server-side functionality.
* __Database:__ MongoDB is utilized, with two collections:
  * __User Collection:__ Stores user signup information.
  * __Notes Collection:__ Stores corresponding user notes.
  
## Security Measures
* __Data Hashing:__ ViNotebook employs hashing techniques to secure sensitive user information, preventing unauthorized access or compromise
*  __JWT Tokens:__ JSON Web Tokens are used for secure authentication, enhancing data protection during user sessions.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
